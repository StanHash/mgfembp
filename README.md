# FE6 Report MultiBoot payload

This is decompilation of a compressed binary that is found in most release ROMs of FE7 and FE8. That binary, when loaded into EWRAM, reports information about save data from an inserted FE6 cartridge via serial communication, presumably enabling some bonus features in japanese FE7.

This builds the following binaries:

- **mgfembp.bin** `sha1: 8a81a47d88f6b0a3f91c49784b9f7b317382abac`
- **mgfembp_20030206.bin** `sha1: 6674fc5b5ee26433665c44b842cdb26bcf785051`
- **mgfembp_20030219.bin** `sha1: ad3ffdb4fc50206f944972a0a7ad26bfa8b5ef74`

**mgfembp.bin** is the final binary that is found in releases of FE7 (JP, US) and FE8 (JP, US, EU). **mgfembp_20030206.bin** and **mgfembp_20030219.bin** are the binaries that are found in the 2003-02-06 and 2003-02-19 beta builds of FE7, respectively.

Big thanks to pfero from the pret Discord for figuring out my compiler issues.

## Quick setup

```bash
# on Debian/Ubuntu variants (such as default WSL2)
sudo apt install build-essential gcc-arm-none-eabi libpng-dev
tools/install-agbcc.sh
make tools
make
```

This requires a very specific variant of the compiler (010110-ThumbPatch) (the install-agbcc script should handle that).
